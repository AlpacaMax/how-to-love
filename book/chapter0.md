#Introduction

This is a programming tutorial made by me, Sheepolution. It's the tutorial that I wish was available when I started learning how to program.

In this tutorial we will be using LÖVE. The reason for this is because LÖVE is very beginner friendly, but at the same time can be very complex. This makes it a great tool for both beginners and experienced users.

This tutorial is written for people without any programming experience. If you do have experience in programming, I recommend you at least read the TL;DR (Too long; Didn't read) of every chapter, and when it confuses you read the full chapter.

If you *don't* have any experience in programming, I hope this tutorial will teach you what you want to know. You probably want to start making a game right away, but I'll have to ask of you to be patient. There are a lot of concepts surrounding programming that you will need to understand before you can start making a game.

That said, I encourage you to "skip ahead". With that I mean try out things that the book hasn't explained to you yet. Play around with what you know already and look up things you want to know. This makes for some great practice and in the end that is what you need.

Some chapters will use code from the previous chapter. In that case I will point it out at the top of the chapter.

This tutorial is still growing, meaning that every month I'll add at least 2 chapters.

If you have any questions, improvements, or anything else to say, feel free to leave a comment behind, and I'll do my best to reply as soon as possible.
