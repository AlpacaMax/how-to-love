# How to (make games with) LÖVE
How to (make games  with) LÖVE is a tutorial series made by me, Sheepolution. I decided to put it on Github so that others can contribute by fixing grammar-errors, code-errors, or even add whole new chapters.

The tutorial is hosted on [sheepolution.com/learn/book](www.sheepolution.com/learn/book).

## Writing a chapter
Every chapter is assumed to be written by Sheepolution. If you write a chapter and want credit for it put the following at the top of your chapter:

```md
#Chapter number - Chapter name
___
*Written by [author name](optional url to twitter/website)*
___
```

### Guidelines

* Get straight to the point.
	* What do we want to do?
	* Optional: Why do we want to do that?
	* How are we going to do that?
* Assume the reader is a 12 year old.
	* Don't assume the reader knows something they might not know.

* Don't state personal opinions as facts.
	* DON'T: Library x is the best!
	* DO: I prefer library x

* Preferably don't use library.
	* For example, don't use an animation library. Animation can teach a lot about quads and good use of tables.
	* You can always end the chapter with recommended libraries regarding the subject.

* End the chapter with a short recap (TL;DR).
