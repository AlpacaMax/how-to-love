# How to (make games with) LÖVE
How to (make games  with) LÖVE is a tutorial series made by me, Sheepolution. I decided to put it on Github so that others can contribute by fixing grammar-errors, code-errors or improvements on wording and explanation.

The tutorial is hosted on [sheepolution.com/learn/book](http://www.sheepolution.com/learn/book/contents).

[Parsedown](http://parsedown.org/tests/) is used to convert markdown to html.


## Planned chapters (random order)

* Tweening
* Terminology
* Clean code
* Physics
* ECS
* Networking

If you have more ideas for chapters, you can open an issue about it.
